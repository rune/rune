Today we're stoked to announce that we're launching a [$100k grant for open-source web games!](https://grant.rune.ai) 🥳

Indie game developers and web devs can now receive a grant to make an open-source multiplayer game using JavaScript / TypeScript. With these grants, we hope to support indie devs wanting to make awesome games and dramatically boost the open-source web game ecosystem!

Rune will award two kinds of grants to indie game devs who make an open-source multiplayer web game:

- **Spark** grants of $500 awarded to promising indie game devs
- **Ignite** grants of $5000 awarded to devs proven themselves with a **Spark** grant

Awardees will also get featured on this blog, in the Rune app and on social media. We think it's a win-win for everyone:

- New exciting multiplayer games on Rune
- Interesting open-source code that others can learn from
- Free money and recognition for talented indie devs

Check out the [grants page](https://grant.rune.ai) for eligibility, application process, and all the details! We're so excited to see all the amazing open-source games that you will make!
