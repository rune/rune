# Simulating Multiplayer

The Rune SDK works with common development tools like Vite, Webpack, and Create React App. When you open the URL provided by your build tool, you should see your multiplayer game running inside a mock Rune app.

To simulate the multiplayer experience during development, Rune runs many instances of your game side-by-side. Here you can emulate network latency, game restarts, etc.

## Run on Your Phone

You can also test your game on your phone. Just connect to the URL provided by your development tool and you'll see a development UI for testing the multiplayer experience. You can also test how your game works on a phone by using Chrome Developer Tools.
