# Cube Rush

A multiplayer racing game built using the Dusk SDK, the goal of which is to reach the finish line before the other players. Here's a [demo](https://developers.rune.ai/examples/cube-rush/).

The game uses [three.js](https://threejs.org/) with WebGL for rendering 3D content. It's inspired by [Cubefield](https://github.com/Christopher-Hayes/cubefield).
