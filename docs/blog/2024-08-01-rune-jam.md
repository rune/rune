Hey everyone! The moment we've all been impatiently waiting for is finally here! Rune’s 1st Jam has officially started and will run from today, August 1st 00:00 UTC, until August 11th 23:59 UTC.

The theme we’ve chosen for the occasion is... **Creativity**! 🧑‍🎨

This summer we want to help players unleash all of their imagination with the theme of "Creativity". Be it through playing in unique scenarios, experimenting with unconventional mechanics, giving life to mythical creatures, or interacting through drawing and images.  

Focus on the aesthetics of the visuals and build a world of colors, shapes, and original designs: players should breathe creativity as soon as they step into the game 🎨 🏞️  Ensure that the game-play involves building, crafting, molding, to trigger the players’ creativity and stimulate their inventiveness 🏗️ 🪵 🧲 🚧
