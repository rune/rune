# AI Quick Start with VSCode / Cursor
:::tip Try our new AI quick start to have a game up and running even faster!!:::
- Create an empty folder (e.gai-game) and open it in VSCode.
- Create a .vscode directory inside the game folder.
- Inside that directory create a file called mcp.json with this content:
```json
 {
   "servers": {
     "Rune": {
       "type": "stdio",
       "command": "npx",
       "args": ["rune-mcp@latest"]
     }
   }
 }
```
- When you save the `mcp.json` file, you should see a little "Start" button appear. Press "Start" and then open up the Copilot window.
- IMPORTANT: Set Copilot to "Agent" mode using Claude 3.7 Sonnet. You should see "🛠️ 9" in copilot since it has detected the 9 Rune tools.
- Now type a prompt to build a Rune game. Here's an example prompt: "I'd like to build the Connect Four game using the Rune SDK. Can you build this as a Rune game for me?"

# Quick Start

Build a multiplayer game for the [Rune platform](https://www.rune.ai) and its millions of players. Rune handles netcode, servers, voice chat, matchmaking, spectating, and much more.

Get started by running:

```sh
npx rune@latest create
```
After this, you'll have a multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game running.

Alternatively, follow the [guide to port your existing game to Rune](./how-it-works/existing-game.md). 

## Uploading & Playing In The App {#playing-the-game-in-app}

Now that you have Tic Tac Toe running locally, it would be great to try playing it in the Rune app:

```sh
npm run upload
```
That's it. You'll now see your game inside Rune and can play it with your friends!

## Game Logic {#game-logic}

Rune games are split into two parts: logic & rendering. Let's look at the logic for the generated Tic Tac Toe game.

You can find the logic code in the `logic.js` file. The `setup` function is responsible for creating an initial `game` state that's synced across players. We create the 3x3 grid for Tic Tac Toe:

```js
function setup() {
  const game = {
    cells: new Array(9).fill(null), // 3x3 cell grid
    // ... rest of the game state
  }
  return game
}
```

To modify the `game` state synced between players, we define actions that get called from the client code. Here's the action to mark a cell in Tic Tac Toe:

```js
function claimCell(cellIndex, { game, playerId }) {
  game.cells[cellIndex] = playerId
  // ... rest of the logic, like checking for win condition
}
```

Finally, we provide setup function, actions, and other game info to `Rune.initLogic()`:

```js
Rune.initLogic({
  minPlayers: 2,
  maxPlayers: 2,
  setup,
  actions: {
    claimCell,
  },
})
```
Other `initLogic()` options are described in [API game logic reference](api-reference.md#game-logic). You can also read a more in-depth explanation of how the logic code works in [Syncing Game State](how-it-works/syncing-game-state.md).


## Rendering & Inputs {#rendering}

You can find your game rendering code in `client.js` file. The client code is responsible for reacting to `game` state changes and updating the rendering accordingly:

```js
function onChange({ game, players, yourPlayerId, action }) {
  const { cells, lastMovePlayerId } = game

  // ... update your game visuals according to latest received game state. Also play sound effects, update styles, etc.
}

Rune.initClient({ onChange })
```

The client code also calls actions based on user input:

```js
const button = // ... get the cell
button.addEventListener("click", () => Rune.actions.claimCell(cellIndex))
```

You can find additional information about [rendering here](how-it-works/syncing-game-state.md#rendering).

## What Next? {#next-steps}

You can also make much fancier games than Tic Tac Toe. Rune supports games with real-time multiplayer, complex physics, beautiful graphics and much more!

Here are some good places to start:
- Get some inspiration by looking at the [example games](/docs/examples/games)
- Game dev is more fun as part of a community, join the [Rune Discord server](https://discord.gg/rune-ai)
- Learn how Rune works underneath by diving into [game state syncing](how-it-works/syncing-game-state.md)
- See the Creator Fund details and how to [make money with Rune](publishing/making-money.md)
