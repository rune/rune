# Supported Games

Rune handles all the complexity of building a multiplayer game. We've made this SDK to make your life simple and we've tried to make it general enough that you can build almost anything. Any game that follows the [overall game guidelines](how-it-works/syncing-game-state.md#restrictions) and [server-side logic](advanced/logic-restrictions.md) guidelines is supported.

## Examples of Supported Games

- Tic Tac Toe, Hex, and other board games
- Chess, Connect Four, Mancala, Battleship, Checkers and other strategy games
- 8 Ball Pool, Golf Around!, Football Tactics & Glory, and other turn-based sports games
- Crosswords, Sudoku, and other co-op games with simultaneous playing
- Catan, Yahtzee, Monopoly and other strategy games with randomness
- Pet Simulator, Powerwash Simulator, The Game of Life, and other simulation games
- Worms World Party, Bowmasters, and other physics-based games 
- Codenames, Guess Who, Werewolf, and other party games

There's a lot more games you can build, these are just some examples to give you an idea of what's possible!

## Adding Support for More Games in Upcoming Version

We have some great updates coming up, including a 60 fps update loop! This'll add support for classics like Snake and modern real-time IO games.
